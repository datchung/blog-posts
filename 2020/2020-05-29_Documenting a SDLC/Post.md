##  1. <a name='introduction'></a>Introduction

I was recently tasked with onboarding newly hired software developers to the SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) at work. Experienced software developers should already be familiar with the SDLC in general but each organization or team will have their own flavour of the SDLC. I wanted to be as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) as possible as there will be times in the future when other new hires will require the same training. I concluded that documenting the SDLC, then having the new hires review the documentation, and then ask for specific clarifications would be the best approach. With this approach, I would not need to re-deliver the same training again (DRY), and I can continue to refine and improve the SDLC documentation based on any questions or clarifications I get.

The next step was to decide on the best way of documenting the SDLC. Note that this will be impacted by the flavour of the SDLC - for example, an Agile SDLC may be best documented in one way, whereas a Waterfall SDLC may be best documented in another way.

### Classic SDLC Diagram

For example, the one presented [here by Mike Cohn](http://www.ambysoft.com/essays/agileLifecycle.html#LifecycleScope) or [this one by PMI](https://www.pmi.org/disciplined-agile/lifecycle/agile-lifecycle).

#### Pros

* Well-accepted and mature diagram
* Depicts the high-level steps of an SDLC
* Picture is easy to understand
* Good supplemental diagram, regardless of flavour of SDLC

#### Cons

* Does not depict what roles are involved and what each role's responsibilities are
* Difficult to modify because the diagram is well-accepted and mature

### Text-Based SDLC Description

For example, listing and describing the steps of the SDLC one by one in a text document.

#### Pros

* Very easy to do - don't need any tools to create a diagram
* Could be good for brainstorming and capturing your ideas
* Could be good as a personal reference

#### Cons

* Hard to follow by others as no pictures are included - could be too abstract
* Heavy reading involved - time consuming for readers

### Role-Based SDLC Diagram

An example is presented in the section [Role-Based SDLC Diagram](#diagram).

#### Pros

* Depicts the roles involved and their responsibilities
* Focused on day to day aspects of SDLC
* Depicts the high-level steps of an SDLC
* Picture is easy to understand

#### Cons

* Less familiar than the Classic SDLC Diagram - I have not encountered this type of diagram anywhere else before
* Less focus on overall/long term aspect of SDLC (eg. Release, Production, Retirement, etc.)
