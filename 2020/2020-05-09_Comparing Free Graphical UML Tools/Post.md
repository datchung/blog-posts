##  1. <a name='introduction'></a>Introduction

When recently looking for a graphical tool to create UML diagrams, I evaluated three options: Visual Paradigm, Lucidchart.com and Draw.io. A limiting requirement is that the tool must be "free".

## 2. <a name='visual'></a>Visual Paradigm
Website: www.visual-paradigm.com/solution/freeumltool

### Pros
* Large feature set

### Cons
* Steep learning curve
* Large installer
* **Only** free for personal and non-commerical purposes

### Summary
Visual Paradigm's free UML tool contains a large feature set and seems like it can handle any UML use case thrown at it. However, this large feature set also means that there is a steep learning curve and large installer - at the time of this writing, the Windows installer is 660MB. If you require non-personal or commercial purposes, then the free version of this tool cannot be used.

## 3. <a name='lucid'></a>Lucidchart.com
Website: www.lucidchart.com

### Pros
* Good knowledge base
  * Written documentation
  * Youtube videos
* Single purpose, specifically for UML diagrams

### Cons
* Free account is limited
  * Limited number of documents
  * Limited number of objects per document
  * And more

### Summary
Lucidchart contains a good knowledge base on UML diagrams and is a good learning resource. The Youtube videos are especially helpful. The tool is also single-purpose, specifically for UML diagrams. On the downside, the free account is very limited and in many cases is only suitable for trial, personal use, or small projects.


## 4. <a name='draw'></a>Draw.io
Website: app.diagrams.net

### Pros
* Available as a web or desktop application
* Few or no restrictions
* Multi-purpose diagram tool
* Short learning curve, intuitive
* Learned skills can be reused to create other diagrams
* PlantUML script support

### Cons
* General purpose tool, not specifically for UML diagrams

### Summary
Draw.io is a free general diagram tool with few restrictions and many useful features. The only negative is that this is a general purpose tool, not specifically for UML diagrams so some UML features may be lacking compared to other tools.

## 5. <a name='conclusion'></a>Conclusion
The free version of Visual Paradigm is not usable for non-personal or commercial purposes, so it is out of the question if that is the required purpose. Lucidchart is promising, but the free account is very limited and the paid account will likely be required for real usage. In the end, Draw.io is the winner with its few restrictions, intuitive design, and general purpose nature.
