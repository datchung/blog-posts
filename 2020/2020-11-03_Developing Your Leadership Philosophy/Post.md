## 1. <a name='introduction'></a>Introduction

["Developing Your Leadership Philosophy"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fdeveloping-your-leadership-philosophy%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url&account=86125970) is a LinkedIn Learning course by Mike Figliuolo. This course is centered around the "Maxims Method" as a means to articulate your leadership philosophy.

### What is a Maxim?

* A principle or rule of conduct, helping you make consistent choices
* A statement that triggers behaviour, reminding you of things that motiviate you and helping you make decisions in difficult situations
* A source of strength to reorient yourself and keep you moving forward
* Simple to explain
* Growing as you grow

Your maxims make up your personal leadership philosophy.

### How Do You Determine Your Maxims?

Write down your maxims during a time of calm.

Some questions to ask to help determine your maxims
* What are the most satisfying aspects of my work?
* What do I want people to say about me when I'm gone?
* What do I stand for as a leader?
* What type of work should I gravitate toward?
* What are my non-negotiables?
* What are things that have prevented me from making bad decisions?

### Why Maxims?

> Accountability is an *external force* that holds us to a set of standards.

> Responsibility is when we hold *ourselves* accountable to a set of standards.

Your team is watching your behaviour. Maxims act as your conscience to ensure appropriate behaviour.

## 3. <a name='yourself'>Lead Yourself</a>

Create maxims to
* Hold yourself accountable to your own standards
* Set standards for your role(s) and behaviours

Keep track of and document your triggers.

## 4. <a name='thinking'>Lead the Thinking</a>

### How to Develop a Vision

* Ask "what is the team's purpose?"
* Make the vision compelling
* Use simple words
* Ask your team for input
* Ask "why" continuously to gain insights
  * "The five whys": there will be an insight after the fifth why
* Question your conclusions

Remember that thoughts are nice but actions matter

Use maxims to articulate your vision and leadership style

### How Do You Want to Behave?

1. When did a leader know something important about you?
2. How did it make you feel?
3. Create a trigger that reminds you of that event and feeling
4. That trigger becomes one of your maxims
5. That maxim will drive your behaviour
