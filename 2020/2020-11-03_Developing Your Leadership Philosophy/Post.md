### What is a Maxim?

* A principle or rule of conduct, helping you make consistent choices
* A statement that triggers behaviour, reminding you of things that motiviate you and helping you make decisions in difficult situations
* A source of strength to reorient yourself and keep you moving forward
* Simple to explain
* Growing as you grow

Your maxims make up your personal leadership philosophy.

### How Do You Determine Your Maxims?

Write down your maxims during a time of calm.

Some questions to ask to help determine your maxims
* What are the most satisfying aspects of my work?
* What do I want people to say about me when I'm gone?
* What do I stand for as a leader?
* What type of work should I gravitate toward?
* What are my non-negotiables?
* What are things that have prevented me from making bad decisions?

### Why Maxims?

> Accountability is an *external force* that holds us to a set of standards.

> Responsibility is when we hold *ourselves* accountable to a set of standards.

Your team is watching your behaviour. Maxims act as your conscience to ensure appropriate behaviour.
