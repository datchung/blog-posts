##  1. <a name='introduction'></a>Introduction

When recently looking for a graphical tool to create UML diagrams, I evaluated three options: Visual Paradigm, Lucidchart.com and Draw.io. A limiting requirement is that the tool must be "free".

## 2. <a name='visual'></a>Visual Paradigm
Website: www.visual-paradigm.com/solution/freeumltool

### Pros
* Large feature set

### Cons
* Steep learning curve
* Large installer
* **Only** free for personal and non-commerical purposes

### Summary
Visual Paradigm's free UML tool contains a large feature set and seems like it can handle any UML use case thrown at it. However, this large feature set also means that there is a steep learning curve and large installer - at the time of this writing, the Windows installer is 660MB. If you require non-personal or commercial purposes, then the free version of this tool cannot be used.

## 3. <a name='lucid'></a>Lucidchart.com
Website: www.lucidchart.com

### Pros
* Good knowledge base
  * Written documentation
  * Youtube videos
* Single purpose, specifically for UML diagrams

### Cons
* Free account is limited
  * Limited number of documents
  * Limited number of objects per document
  * And more

### Summary

Lucidchart contains a good knowledge base on UML diagrams and is a good learning resource. The Youtube videos are especially helpful. The tool is also single-purpose, specifically for UML diagrams. On the downside, the free account is very limited and in many cases is only suitable for personal use or small projects.
