##  1. <a name='introduction'></a>Introduction

This is how I built a barrier to keep animals out of my new garden. My goal was to create something cost effective, sturdy, accessible via a front "door", and simple to make with minimal tools.

## 2. <a name='dimensions'></a>Dimensions

Since construction is so simple, I drew up the plans by hand.

### Top View

The left and top walls are fence posts and fence boards. Dimensions are in cm.

### ISO View

Below is the ISO view along with the cut list. Horizontal boards are 1.9cm (3/4") thick. Posts are 3.8x3.8cm (1.5x1.5"). The upper horizontal boards are half the width of the lower horizontal boards. This keeps the upper weight down and saves costs (since the structure is strong enough even with narrower upper boards). The lower boards need to be wide since half of the width will be buried underground to act as the garden bed's edging. Dimensions are in cm.
