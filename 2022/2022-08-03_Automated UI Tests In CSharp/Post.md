## 1. <a name='intro'></a>Introduction

Writing automated UI tests in C# is possible with the use of a library known as WinAppDriver. Quoted from the [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppDriver) page:

> Windows Application Driver (WinAppDriver) is a service to support Selenium-like UI Test Automation on Windows Applications. This service supports testing Universal Windows Platform (UWP), Windows Forms (WinForms), Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), and Classic Windows (Win32) apps on Windows 10 PCs.

This article introduces WinApppDriver, how to get started, and how to write basic tests.
